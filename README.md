### Music PI



#### Have many audio files, But no convenient management and playback software?

Music PI is prepared for this.

I offered a [raspberry pi image](https://github.com/dodoma/mdesk) and an [Andorid app](https://github.com/dodoma/mpocket).

Burn the image into raspberry pi, Install the app to your phone, and setting the network to use it.

Music Pi support FLAC、MP3、WAV format audio file currently. Before use it, make sure read the [FAQ](faq.md) first.

Not like [volumio](https://volumio.com/)，Music PI can cache audio file into your phone, and play it by phone.

This is a [use demo1](https://avm.mbox.net.cn/avm-phone.mp4)  [use demo2](https://avm.mbox.net.cn/avm-all.mp4)
